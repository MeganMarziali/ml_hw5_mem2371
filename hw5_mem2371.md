## Part 1: Set-up

### Problem set-up

##### Loading required packages

The following code chunk loads the required packages for the assignment.

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
library(caret)
library(glmnet)

set.seed(100)
```

##### Loading data into environment and cleaning

``` r
alc_data = 
  read.csv("./data/alcohol_use.csv", na = c("", ".", "NA", ".d", ".r")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    alc_consumption = as.factor(alc_consumption)
  ) %>% 
  select(-x)

summary(alc_data)
```

To clean the data, I stripped off the ID variable and recoded the
alcohol consumption variable as a factor. The complete dataset includes
1885 observations. No missing observations are present within the data.

##### Data partitioning

``` r
train.indices = createDataPartition(y = alc_data$alc_consumption,p = 0.7,list = FALSE)

training = alc_data[train.indices,]
testing = alc_data[-train.indices,]

#Store outcome 
alc_train = training$alc_consumption
alc_test = testing$alc_consumption

#Model.matrix shortcut to removing outcome variable from matrix
x_train = model.matrix(alc_consumption~., training)[,-1]
x_test = model.matrix(alc_consumption~., testing)[,-1]
```

## Problem 1

### 1.A: Choosing alpha and lambda via cross-validation

``` r
en.model<- train(
  alc_consumption ~., data = training, method = "glmnet",
  trControl = trainControl("cv", number = 10),
 tuneLength=10
  )

#Train control for values of hyperparameters, folds, etc.

#Print the values of alpha and lambda that gave best prediction
en.model$bestTune
```

    ##    alpha    lambda
    ## 54   0.6 0.2593237
